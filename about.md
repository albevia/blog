title: About this blog
---

I never imagined the experience I had when for the first time I touched a computer a long time ago that it was going to let me discover my passion. Today I still enjoy developing software. I continue learning and applying new theories and strategies as a result of its evolution. The software development is huge, for that reason is imposible try to cover all the different branches that has been emerging. Actually I am concentrated with Java, Web Services, continuous integration and the implementation of new architectures such as reactive programming.

I pretend use this space to share ideas about what I like to do. My passion is the technology and not stop surprising me new things that are discovered. I want to share with you comments, opinions, and proofs of concepts so far I have been doing about software development and its processes into this disruptive age.

### About the Author

My name is Alberto Ibanez. I am computer engineer developing software and giving support to different companies in different sectors since 1999.

At the beginning of 2015 year, I started to create this site for two principal reasons: 

1. When I discover a new concept, it's not enough taking only the theory, it must be linked with a proof of concept (i.e. the practice) and for our times it's easy using recent new tools.

2. This site is a very useful tool to share the knowledge. The discoveries happen quickly and it's important have a place where it could be shared not only to me, but it also to anyone interested on these topics.


This blog is designed to be simple, clean, and responsive.
