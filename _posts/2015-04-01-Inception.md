We are happy to announce the creation of this site where we are going to share knowledge about `software and its artifacts based on innovations`.
Different branches have emerged such as cloud computing, business analytics, Internet of things, IT services, and so on. It's not an easy task try to cover all this branches, although these have something in common, the software construction. 

###Conceptual Tools

With Web Services recently has been important the focus of [Microservices architecture][1] that promotes other form of thinking and it affects all these branches. Other is the [Reactive Programming][2], it creates another paradigm for software development. Microservices, Reactive Programming and so on, are examples of new conceptual tools that enable you to think through alternative solutions that apply to the task at hand. It also develops the necessary skills to produce quality implementations.

###Building Blocks

There are situations when it's important to construct something without waste time preparing the elements. For example, into the software area exists frameworks to help the programmer to concentrate on their business problem at hand.
The characteristics that these building blocks must cover are: Simplicity, productivity, and usability.
`Simplicity` comes from making it easy to do simple things in a few lines of code without extensive configuration. `Productivity` starts with being able to make a code change. `Usability` is related to the developer productivity, but also to developer happiness.
You are certainly more productive if it's easier to simply get things done, no matter how smart you are, but a usable framework or a building block can be more than that; it can be a joy to use. Fun, even.

Our task here is bring you the recent conceptual tools, but at the same time bring you too the building blocks so that you can implement them.
