“This is a pivotal time in the database world. For years the relational model has been the de facto option for big and small problems. We don’t expect relational databases will fade away anytime soon, but people are emerging from the RDBMS fog to discover alternative options, such as schemaless or alternative data structures, simple replication, high availability, horizontal scaling, and new query methods. These options are collectively known as NoSQL”. Text taken from the book [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks][1].

Into the spectrum of NoSQL database styles there are various functionalities and trade-offs that each database has –durability vs. speed, absolute vs. eventual consistency, and so on- 

Redis belongs to the NoSQL world. It provides for complex datatypes like sorted sets and hashes, as well as basic message patterns like publish-subscribe and blocking queues. It also has one of the most robust query mechanisms for a KV store. And by caching writes in memory before committing to disk. Redis gains amazing performance in exchange for increased risk of data loss in the case of hardware failure. This characteristic makes it a good fit for caching noncritical data and for acting as a message broker.

### Installation

The Redis project does not officially support Windows. However, the Microsoft Open Tech group develops and maintains this Windows port targeting Win64.

There is another way to install Redis based on Chocolatey and this is the procedure we are going to show here.

### Install Chocolatey

Go to https://chocolatey.org and follow the steps to install it. Open a cmd console and execute the next command
{% highlight PowerShell%}
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
{% endhighlight %}

Open the PowerShell console with Admin rights and execute the next command.  
{% highlight PowerShell%}
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
{% endhighlight %}

Next step is install Redis with Chocolatey. Execute {% highlight PowerShell%} choco install redis-64 {% endhighlight %} into the PowerShell console.
You can verify any upgrade using the command {% highlight PowerShell%} choco upgrade redis-64 {% endhighlight %}
Run redis with the command ‘redis-server’![Redis Server]({{site.url}}/assets/2015-08-01/03 redisServer.jpg)
Open other PowerShell console and execute the next command {% highlight PowerShell%} redis-cli {% endhighlight %} ![Redis CLI]({{site.url}}/assets/2015-08-01/04 redisCLI.jpg)
You can test your Redis database using the commands showed into http://try.redis.io/ 

### Simple Application using Redis

The application is based on Java because this is the most commonly programming language used.

####Testing the data persistence

I created an Eclipse project based on Java in [Github][2] where you can download it and test it.

When you execute the file `HelloRedis.java`, the next output is showed
{% highlight PowerShell%}
Connected to Redis.
Setting values
set city=berlin
set temperature=18
getting values
city=berlin, temperature=18
Done
{% endhighlight %}

With the Publisher-Subscriber there are two files (`Publisher.java` and `Subscriber.java`). You could create another Java project including only the file `Subscriber.java`. Execute both projects and you will visualize how the subscriber shows information that the publisher send or pubish.
